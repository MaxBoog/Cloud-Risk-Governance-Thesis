# Cloud Risk Governance Thesis

This repository contains the research outputs and supporting materials developed as part of the Master's thesis **"A Thesis on Cloud Risk Governance: Validating Cloud Risk Maturity Through Control Classification and Service Model Alignment An Approach to Cloud Risk Domain Structuring, Control Discovery, and Progressive Maturity Assessment"**. The thesis introduces a structured, risk-based maturity model tailored for organizations leveraging cloud services, combining insights from academic literature, expert validation, and real-world testing.

## Thesis Overview

The thesis addresses the gap between abstract security standards and actionable cloud governance by building **two complementary systems**:

1. **A maturity classification system** that maps cloud risk domains to specific controls and organizes them across five maturity levels. This model was validated using a two-round Delphi study involving 21 cloud risk experts.
2. **An assessment tool** that applies the model in practice, enabling organizations to evaluate their cloud risk governance maturity based on service model applicability and implementation status.

The approach accounts for the **shared responsibility model** and helps organizations prioritize risk controls, benchmark maturity, and identify gaps.

## Repository Contents

-  Includes the full results of the literature study that identified top cloud risk domains and relevant control frameworks (SCF, CSA CCM, CIS, ISO 27017, NIST 800-53r5, OWASP).

- Contains anonymized Delphi study data and analysis used to validate maturity level classification of 183 cloud risk controls.

- Includes supporting material and findings from the case study performed at a Dutch health insurance provider, applying the maturity model and assessment tool in an IaaS migration context.
 
-  A clean version of the self-assessment tool
- The filled-in version completed by the participating organization as part of the case study.
